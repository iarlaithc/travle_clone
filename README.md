Beginnings of a travel.earth game clone in rust.
At the moment it just tells you how to connect 2 countries.

ToDo:
 - CLI game interface (list 2 countries and ask for user to enter the steps between(any order)).
 - Show full country names for readability.
 - Hint if country guessed is near but not perfect on the list?
 - Regex for country names guesses / suggestions for guesser.
 - Score system.
 - Better GUI than CLI.
